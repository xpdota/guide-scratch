# FFXIV Guides for Random Stuff

This is where I throw my guides. Some of them are drafts of guides that will be posted elsewhere, others are
freestanding guides.

The guides in here that aren't available elsewhere are:

* [ACT Log Guide](/3pty/LogGuide.md), an updated version of
  the [Cactbot Log Guide](https://github.com/quisquous/cactbot/blob/main/docs/LogGuide.md#network-log-lines)
    * The Cactbot version will sometimes lag behind if the log format changes, due to parts of it being auto-generated
      from actual cactbot code, combined with Cactbot needing to support China/Korea which are not on the same patch
      cycle.
* [Interfacing With OverlayPlugin](/3pty/OverlayPlugin.md) - OverlayPlugin is a great tool for more than just overlays.
  This guide explains how to connect to it and use it outside of an overlay.
* [Third Party Addons By Use Case](/3pty/WhatTool.md) - What tools to use for which use cases (DoT tracker, triggers,
  etc)

I make the tool called [Triggevent](https://github.com/xpdota/event-trigger) which I made to address shortcomings in 
some of the other 3rd party tools out there. Give it a look!
