# Sage: The Basics

Welcome to the basic guide for Sage, which should give you everything you need to get started. This guide is meant to be
fairly basic and does not cover every little detail. However, it should point you in the right general direction, and
give you a feel for the class.

## Overview

Sage is a very powerful healer with a smooth flow and straightforward skills. Sage brings high personal damage, tons of
free healing, and low cooldown mitigation to the party. Kardia is a unique buff, with no duration, that will heal its
target for free when you use an offensive GCD. Addersgall is your main gauge resource, with a free charge every 30
seconds, allowing powerful oGCD heals to be used.

### What Makes Sage Unique?

Sage has the highest personal DPS of all the healers, but does not have a raid buff. It has a very high amount of free
healing. While it does have GCD heals as a last resort, they are a bit weaker than other healers. Thus, while Sage is
one of the best healers at keeping the party alive and topped up, it is one of the worst at recovering when things go
downhill. Thus, you need to be proactive. However, its relatively low cooldowns make that a little easier than you'd
think. It also can move around quite a bit without much, if any, damage loss, but doing so requires planning ahead a
bit.

### Playstyle

As with the three other healers, Sage has a 30 second dot with a 1.5 cast time filler GCD. However, it is unique in that
it has the only healer burst GCD with a charge time. By using charges rather than a hard cooldown on its primary burst,
you don't have to worry quite as much about alignment, making it somewhat more ideal than other healers if you aren't
going to be able to gear up as quickly.

Apart from resources shared by all healers, such as mana, Sage has three main resources:

1. Phlemga charges - two charges max, 45 second charge time, allows one cast of Phlegma.
2. Addersgall stacks - three charges max, 30 second charge time, allows one use of Druochole, Kerachole, Ixochole, or Taurochole.
3. Addersting stacks - three charges max, gains a charge when the shield from your Eukrasian Diagnosis is fully consumed.

The bar on the gauge shows the charge time for Addersgall. Current Addersgall charges are displayed at the top of the
gauge, and Adderstring stacks are displayed at the bottom.

### Opener

![Standard Sage Opener](https://www.thebalanceffxiv.com/img/sge_standard.png)

While there are other openers available in the [Openers] page, the basics are as follows:

- Use a Tincture of Mind when 3 seconds are left on the countdown
- Start casting Dosis with 1.5 seconds left
- Immediately use Eukrasian Dosis
- Begin casting Dosis until raid buffs are up (typically, this would mean two Doses)
- Use both Phlegma charges in raid buffs
- Continue using Dosis

### Rotation

The standard rotation is again similar to other healers, in that you would want to make sure your DoT is active 100%
of the time.
