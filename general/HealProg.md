# Healing When You Actually Need to Heal

A guide for Ultimate. Some of these also apply to early Savage prog, where you will also see yourself using more GCD
heals.

### Stylistic Note

You may see names like "Cure I" or "Medica I" even though the in-game wording is just "Cure" or "Medica". This is 
done intentionally in order to more clearly differentiate it from other versions of the spell.

If you see '*' after a potency number, it indicates that the heal in question is a HoT. The two things to note here 
are that you will lose some efficiency if you re-up it early, though in some cases this is still okay (especially 
with Medica II). The second is that the effective potency will be higher (relative to direct heals) if you have 
Spell Speed.

## You Will Be Using GCDs To Heal

Once you've been reclearing a raid tier for a while, it's easy to forget what healing feels like in an ultimate or early
savage prog. You won't just be GCD healing because you're still progging the fight - even an optimized run of an
ultimate is going to involve quite a bit of GCD healing. As such, you tend to not really think about "optimizing" 
GCD heals, since that would be an oxymoron in any other scenario.

## GCD versus oGCD planning

In optimized savage gameplay, you would reach for oGCDs before GCDs.

In ultimates, you will not be able to heal using only oGCDs. In addition, there may be heal checks where you need to use
both GCDs and oGCDs. This means that planning heals is more important, as using oGCDs prematurely may leave you without
the healing or mitigation tools you need for a heal check.

## GCD Priority

Not every GCD heal is equally effective. You should map out how much healing potency your GCDs provide, as well as those
of your co-healer. You'll also want to look at your offensive GCDs to get an idea of opportunity cost. Your goal is
still to lose as little damage as possible. You may also be surprised at what certain AoE heals are capable of, even
when only one or two targets needs healing.

Let's take White Mage for example:

For single-target healing, our GCD priority would look something like this:

1. Regen (2000p*)
2. Medica II (1000p*, but costs more mana)
3. Cure II/Afflatus Solace (800p)
4. Cure I (500p, only applicable if on low mana)

For multi-target healing, the priority would look like:

1. Medica II (1000p*)
2. Cure III (600p*)
3. Medica I/Afflatus Rapture (400p)

It might surprise you that Medica II is actually your second most powerful *single-target* heal - however, you need 
to take the mana cost into account.

### Don't "Focus One Tank"

Two of the three ultimates have phases where both tanks will need to be actively healed. Often times, newer healers will
fall into the trap of each healer focusing on one tank. This is highly inefficient and does not make it easier to heal.

This applies to all of the healers. With our White Mage example, we absolutely want to have Regen on both tanks - 
it's 2000p. We'd also want to have Medica II on both tanks, for another 2000p. A Cure II would only give us 800p - 
less than half the value! We want to stick to the more efficient heals, and have our co-healer do the same.

Take Scholar as another example. For two target scenarios, both Succor (2x520p) and Adloquium (1380p for a crit, 840p 
otherwise) are great options. The problem is, our healing output would be bottlenecked by the fact that we have to 
wait for the shield to be absorbed before we can apply a new one. This likely won't happen within the span of one 
GCD. Therefore, if we are focusing on a single target, we'd need to use Physick between Adloqium casts. Physick's 
pitiful 450p potency makes it a very inefficient use of a GCD.

However, if we were to not try to focus on either tank in particular, we could just use Adloqium on them, 
alternating targets. This would give sufficient time for the shield to be consumed, increasing our healing output 
dramatically.

### Downtime

During hard downtime (i.e. boss not targetable), priority goes out the window. Feel free to use Cure I, as it will save
you mana and doesn't carry any of the usual disadvantages in such a scenario.

## Piety

You'll likely need more than base piety for ultimates. Don't overestimate the damage loss from grabbing piety. In 
addition, some of the tips in this guide encourage using heals that put out more healing, at the cost of mana (e.g. 
Medica II or Adloquium). It is better to get more piety than to lean on "Mana Saving" abilities like Cure I or Physick.

## Optimize As You Go

When you see a new mechanic, start out by healing it in a very safe manner. Start cutting heals out once you're 
comfortable with resolving the mechanic. It will take you a while to prog an ultimate, so there's plenty of time to 
optimize earlier mechanics that you've progged past already. However, don't get too comfy - you may have to replan a 
bit if it turns out that the *next* mechanic is going to require more cooldowns than you had planned for.
